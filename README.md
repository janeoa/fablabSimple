# fablabSimple

Project is done for NU ABC Fablab for free for anyone to use and with ability to update/upgrade

## Pseudo MVC
Done just on .htaccess file with simple route via index.php. Models are stored in /api and return both JSON and php object depending on argument (obj by default). /pages stores all the usefull views. The are no actual controllers, but there are some main files that exists on every page (like config and helpers).

## Issues
* Sometimes it is hard to track origin of the function and you have to dig though the /api files.
